            Mark McCoy Jr. is a fourth-year information technology student born in Honolulu, Hawaii and raised in Jacksonville,
            Florida. He attended private/charter school for majority of my elementary years up until seventh grade where he
            attended a magnet school James Weldon Johnson. He proceeded from there into its feeder high school, Paxon School
            for Advanced Studies and did half of his high school years there before he transferred to the high school he would
            graduate from, Sandalwood High. In school he was involved in various sports from basketball to track, joined basically
            getting to experience everything that grabbed his interest. Mark came to FAMU in Fall 2019 with a different mindset
            of putting his all towards education not involving himself in distractions. Four years in and he has had an internship
            offers from multiple companies, received incredible job offers, met some great people, and learned a lot that he
            can apply to life in and out of his career. Being a timid personality and enrolling in a major that is usually
            filled with introverts, Markâ€™s biggest challenge was getting out of his shell. With going to career fairs, interest
            meetings, and even his job as a sales associate at the mall all contributed to giving him a voice that would take
            him to the next level. Mark is experienced in a vast list of programming languages such as: C++, C Sharp, CSS,
            JavaScript, HTML, and PHP. Throughout his learning in his courses and internships outside of school some other
            notable skills are Android Studios app programming, Power Automate designing, Ubuntu security and more.
